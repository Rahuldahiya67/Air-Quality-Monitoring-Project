<h1>Air Quality Monitoring Project</h1>
<p>Public health is directly impacted by air quality, one of the most important environmental factors. The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data across major Philippine cities using PySpark and Databricks. A data stream is simulated, window-based stream processing is implemented, detailed data analysis is done, and dynamic visualizations are made.</p>
